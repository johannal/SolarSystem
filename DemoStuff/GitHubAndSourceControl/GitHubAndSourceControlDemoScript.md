### Github Accounts
- Thanks, Matthew!  Good afternoon, everyone! Today I want to show you some of the great new ways to work with source control in Xcode, and especially how Xcode can work with Github.
- Getting started with GitHub is easy.
- **Choose Preferences -> Accounts**
- **Click plus button**
- Xcode supports both github.com and github enterprise.
- **Choose Github**
- I just enter my name and password, 
- **Enter WWDC2017, mfdemo2017**
- ...and my account is all set up.

### Clone...
- So, let's go get a repository
- **Close Prefs**
- **Cmd-Shift-1**
- **Welcome window: Clone...**
- Xcode has an all new clone workflow that makes getting content from Github easy.
- All my GitHub repositories are front and center. My personal repositories, any I have marked with a star, and repositories from my organizations.
- There are details for the selected repository... its description, primary language, and the number of forks and stars.
- For more information I can view the repository's README.
- **Click README**
- **Close it**
- Using the search field I can search GitHub.
- **Type "corelibs project" in search**
- When I find something I can clone it directly or I can star it.
- **Star swift-corelibs-foundation**
- **Cancel search**
- Now that it's starred I see it in my main list.
- **Select swift-corelibs-foundation**
- **Clone...**
- I'll select a location for my clone
- **Choose save location Documents/Demo**

### Explore
- Once the clone completes, Xcode opens the project.
- **Go to Source Control navigator**
- Xcode 9 has a new navigator that is devoted to source control.
- I see the repositories in my workspace.
- Inside a repository I see its branches
- **Select Branches group**
- ... tags 
- **Select Tags group**
- ... and remotes.
- **Select Remotes group**
- Selecting a branch shows its complete history.
- **Select current branch**
- We pull avatars from Github for the authors of commits.
- And there are annotations showing tags
- **Select a commit that has a tag**
- ... and branches.
- **Select a commit that is a branch head**
- I can filter the history by author or commit message.
- I'll find the commits that Philippe made,
- **Type "hausler", select author filter**
- ... and I'll narrow it down a little more.
- **Type "value" and hit enter**
- **Select the "value type" commit**
- Once I find a commit, the inspector shows even more detail,
- ... including all the files that were changed by this commit. 
- This looks like the one I was looking for.
- **Close inspector**
- Double-clicking a commit takes me to the new commit viewer,
- **Double-click the "value types" commit**
- **Starts on build.py**
- ... where I can see all the source changes.
- **Select NSDecimalNumber.swift**
- Xcode 9 makes it easy to browse history and really get down to detailed changes.

### Creating branches
- Xcode can also help you manage source control while you're making changes.
- I have a project that that needs some changes before I share it with the world
- **Close the explore project**
- **Window -> SolarSystem**
- When I start working, the source contriol navigator makes it easy to create a new branch.
- **Go to Source Control navigator**
- **Use context menu to make a branch (DO NOT SELECT IT)**
- OK, I am checked out on my new branch and ready to make changes.

### Structure editing
- **Go to Project navigator**
- In my projects I like to keep the group structure and Finder structure the same.
- Xcode 9 makes this easy.
- In projects where these structures _are_ the same Xcode will automatically _keep_ them the same.
- When I move files between groups, they move in Finder too.
- **Move some camera model classes from Fly-By group to ObjectOfNote group**
- When I rename the group, it the folder is renamed as well.
- **Rename ObjectOfNote group to CameraModel**
- Best of all, as I am doing all of this these changes are being registered with source control.
- **Source Control->Commit...**
- When I commit, I can see that Xcode knows about all the changes I've been making in the file system as well as in the project
- **Type a comment and commit**

### Working with Branches and Tags
- When I am ready to land my branch, I go back to the source control navigator,
- **Go to Source Control navigator**
- ... select the destination branch, 
- **Select master branch**
- ... and merge
- **Use context menu Merge from working branch into master**
- I can also easily create new tags from any commit.
- **Select new commit in log view**
- **Use context menu to choose New Tag...**

### Create on github
- Now I am ready to share my app. 
- This project isn't on Github yet, but I can easily put it there.
- **Select repo**
- **Use gear menu to create a new github project and push**
- All the defaults look good.
- Xcode creates the project, pushes up all the content, and...
- my project is now hosted on Github!
- I can jump right to Github to see it from the new origin remote.
- **Open remotes group**
- **Right click origin and choose Show in GitHub**
- And here it is.

### Conclusion
- Xcode 9 has some great new source control features to help you understand your project's history, implement new features, and to use GitHub to collaborate with all the other developers out there.
- I hope you'll give it a try and let us know what you think!
- Thank you.


### Random Radars

##### Beta 1
- <rdar://problem/32390457> [SOTU] When the SCM history view loads for the first time after launching Xcode and you have a cache, we don't read the cache

##### Fixed
- <rdar://problem/32332306> Add a "View on GitHubâ€¦" contextual menu for a GitHub-hosted remote
- <rdar://problem/32390411> [SOTU] When you star from a search result we should reflect the star back in the reachable list
- <rdar://problem/32039210> Repositories Window: When the window first comes up, the first repo in the list should be selected
- <rdar://problem/32390407> [SOTU] We need to finder sort in the buckets for the reachable repositories
- <rdar://problem/32391218> [SOTU] Can we make the "R" / rename indicators show up faster
- <rdar://problem/32402123> [SotU] Default to suppress the Merge comparison sheet
