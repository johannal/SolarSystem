## Editor Presentation
- Multiple fonts and weights
- Plus to increase editor font size
- Issue presentation (including static analysis)
    Avoid wrapping code
    Multiple fix-it's available and click-able at the same time
    Added custom colors for issues when you have a dark background
- Switch to different theme (via Editor menu)
    We made it a little easier to switch themes

## Issues
- Too new API (if we can get a fix it?)
- Swift file conforming to a protocol (help you to write code)
- Method declaration with a space in the name
- Switch/case (issue and you can right-click on default to add missing cases)

## Editor Performance
- Open large file
-   1. Scroling performance
-   2. Editing performance
-   3. Jump to the bottom or top almost instantly

## Extended Editors
- Markdown editor
-   1. Landmarks
-   2. Jump-to-definition/links
-   3. Edit-all-in-scope

## Structured Editing
- Tokenization, talk about structure menu
- Show various structure items (click around a bit)
- Code folding (?)
- Adding "else" or negating condition
- Extract
-   1. Structure selection, action pop up, extract
-   2. Edit-all-in-scope kicks in
- Edit all in scope
- Refactoring / project-wide (with code roll, multiple languages)
-   1. do a simple refactor first, all in Swift
-   2. do a more complicated refactor second, spans languages, file types, file names, comments

Can we show an extension?
